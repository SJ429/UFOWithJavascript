### JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

This project was to use JavaScript to create an interactive website.  Specifically, D3.js  was used to collect HTML form elements in the form of DOMs and adding event triggers to elements on the page filter fom the given dataset based on user entry. 

A webpage for UFO sightings can be found at https://sj429.github.io/javascript-challenge/

The Website allows the user to enter a date in the date field and filter the table according to that date and display it once the "Filter Table" button is pressed or the Enter key is pressed on the keyboard.

Additionaly, the user can filter and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the following table columns:

        date/time

        city

        state

        country

        shape
