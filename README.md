### JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

This project demonstrates the use of Javascript to create an interactive website, specifically using D3.js to collect HTML form elements in the form of DOMs and adding event triggers to elements on the page filter the given dataset based on user entry. 

Website is at https://sj429.github.io/javascript-challenge/

The dataset is a sample set of UFO sightings in the U.S.

The Basic site allows the user to enter a date in the date field and filter the table according to that date and display it once the "Filter Table" button is pressed or the Enter key is pressed on the keyboard.

A webpage for UFO sightings that uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js. 
Used JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js, to create a table dynamically based upon a dataset provided. Users are allowed to filter the table data for specific values.

Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search
Used the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code that appended a table to your web page and then added new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

Level 2: Multiple Search Categories
Wrote JavaScript code to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

date/time
city
state
country
shape
