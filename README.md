	## JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

Used JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js, to create a table dynamically based upon a dataset provided. Users are allowed to filter the table data for specific values.


### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

Used the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code that appended a table to your web page and then added new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional)

Wrote JavaScript code to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:
  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
