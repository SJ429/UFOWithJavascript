### JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

This project was to use JavaScript to create a dynamic table so an interactive website which allows filtering in the table was created.  

Specifically, D3.js was used to collect HTML form elements with added event triggers to elements on the page filter from the given dataset based on user entry.

A webpage for UFO sightings can be found at https://sj429.github.io/UFOWithJavascript/



The Website allows the user to enter a date in the date field and filter the table according to that date and display it once the "Filter Table" button is pressed or the Enter key is pressed on the keyboard.

Additionally, the user can filter and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the following table columns:
