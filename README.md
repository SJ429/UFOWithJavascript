### JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript to create an interactive website, specifically using D3.js to collect HTML form elements in the form of DOMs and adding event triggers to elements on the page filter the given dataset based on user entry. 

The Website allows the user to enter a date in the date field and filter the table according to that date and display it once the "Filter Table" button is pressed or the Enter key is pressed on the keyboard.

A webpage for UFO sightings can be found at https://sj429.github.io/javascript-challenge/

The dataset is a sample set of UFO sightings in the U.S.
Filter and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

date/time

city

state

country
